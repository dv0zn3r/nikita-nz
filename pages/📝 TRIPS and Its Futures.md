	- #### Key Takeaways
		- [1] The [[TRIPS Agreement]] has had a significant impact on the [international intellectual property]([[International IP]]) regime, and its high standards have been both praised and criticised by different countries and stakeholders.
		- [2] The [[TRIPS Agreement]] has contributed to the globalisation of intellectual property law and has led to the harmonisation of [IP standards]([[IP Minimum Standards]]) across different countries.
		- [3] The [[TRIPS Agreement]] has been a source of tension and conflict between developed and developing countries, as the latter have often felt that the agreement prioritises the interests of the former.
		- [4] The rise of emerging countries has challenged the traditional power dynamics within the [[WTO]] and other intergovernmental bodies, and has led to new coalitions and alliances among different countries.
		- [5] The future of the [[TRIPS Agreement]] and the [international intellectual property]([[International IP]]) regime is uncertain, as new technologies and changing economic conditions continue to shape the global IP landscape.
			- [5.1] [[Peter Yu]] proposes three recommendations for the future development of the [[TRIPS Agreement]]:
				- [5.1.1] The institution of a periodic review mechanism to ensure that the agreement remains relevant and responsive to changing economic and technological conditions.
				- [5.1.2] The broadening of the focus of the [[TRIPS Agreement]] to cover other areas of innovation beyond traditional intellectual property, such as genetic resources, traditional knowledge, and cultural expressions.
				- [5.1.3] Greater regulatory coordination with other instruments relating to intellectual property protection and the relevant intergovernmental bodies, such as the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] (WIPO) and the [[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development]] (UNCTAD).
			- [5.2] [[Peter Yu]] suggests that these recommendations could be implemented even without a major overhaul of the [[TRIPS Agreement]], which would require the ratification of two-thirds of the [[WTO]] membership and consensus among its members.
