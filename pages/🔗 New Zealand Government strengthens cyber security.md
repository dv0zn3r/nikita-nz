	- To strengthen cyber security readiness and response in New Zealand, a lead operational agency will be established, bringing together the Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT NZ) and the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC). This integration aims to provide authoritative advice and incident response across all threat levels, following international best practices. The move comes in response to the growing scale and sophistication of cyber security threats faced by the country, and it is expected to better protect communities, businesses, and government services. The new agency is expected to start working on [[31.08.2023]].
