- The integration of collaborative robots ([[cobots]]) alongside human workers in shared environments has outpaced the existing regulatory frameworks concerning occupational health and safety (OHS) within the [[European Union]], failing to address the unique challenges of human-robot interaction ([[HRI]]) and particularly those involving smart cobots ([[SmaCobs]]). The authors argue for the incorporation of OHS enforcement mechanisms directly into the operation of [[SmaCobs]], utilising advanced technologies like quantum computing to adapt and respond to specific situational needs, possibly presenting a safer and more cost-effective solution than relying on human enforcement. To address the emergent legal, ethical, and explanatory challenges posed by autonomous [[SmaCobs]], a new and binding OHS Regulation tailored for the "SmaCobs age" is proposed for the [[EU]].
