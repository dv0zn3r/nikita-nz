- The Open Australian Legal Corpus stands as the inaugural extensive, multi-jurisdictional open corpus containing Australian legislative and judicial documents. Encompassing over 60 million lines and 1.4 billion tokens within 228,612 texts, the Corpus contains all current statutes and regulations from multiple Australian jurisdictions and a substantial collection of bills and court decisions, with the aim of advancing legal AI research. With the inclusion of a wide array of documents under open source licences suitable for both non-commercial and commercial use, the Corpus acts as a significant resource for tasks such as document classification and question answering in the legal domain.
