	- In this legal article, [[Mark Lamley]] argues that while [[United States]] courts are currently focusing on copyright issues related to [generative AI]([[Generative AI]]), such as ownership and [fair use]([[Fair Use]]), the most significant impact of generative AI on [copyright law]([[Copyright]]) goes beyond these issues. He contends that the new model of creativity employed by generative AI challenges two fundamental legal doctrines of copyright: the [idea-expression dichotomy]([[Idea-Expression Dichotomy]]) and the substantial similarity test for infringement. With generative AI, creativity is primarily centered around asking the right questions, rather than providing the answers. [Lamley]([[Mark Lamley]]) concludes that this shift undermines the traditional basis for copyright protection and necessitates a reevaluation of infringement tests or the application of these tests in different ways.
