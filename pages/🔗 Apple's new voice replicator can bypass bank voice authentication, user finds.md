	- Banks are predicted to implement additional security measures in response to new voice replication technology on iPhones. The iOS 17 upgrade will introduce an accessibility tool that repeats typed text after a series of randomised voice prompts. However, concerns have been raised about the potential misuse of this technology, as demonstrated by an early version that tricked a phone banking voice authentication system. Surveyed experts suggest that banks should enhance verification processes, employ two-factor authentication, and collaborate with Apple to prevent fraudulent activities and ensure data privacy.
