- This review article provides an insightful overview of the field of [[AI audit]], outlining that researchers can draw valuable lessons from established auditing practices in other domains to better structure [[AI]] system audits. It highlights the mutual interest of policymakers and technology providers in [[AI audit]] as a governance mechanism, recognising the role of academic researchers in assessing the practicability and effectiveness of various auditing procedures. The article concludes by advocating for an integrated approach that combines technology-focused and process-oriented audits, aiming for comprehensive assessments of [[AI]]'s design, use, and broader impacts on users, societies, and the environment over time.
