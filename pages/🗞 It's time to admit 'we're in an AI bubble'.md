- [[Artificial Intelligence]] (AI) technology is being significantly hyped in [[2023]], with substantial investments and ambitious claims about its transformational potential, while experts note risks and prioritise the mitigation of existential dangers posed by [[AI]] advancements. Despite sensational successes, the actual pace of [[AI]] development is more moderate and largely stemming from prior decades of research, with the scale of data inputs for [[AI models]] potentially reaching a plateau due to [[data availability]] and [[legal challenges]]. The current enthusiasm around [[AI]] mirrors a bubble phenomenon, whereby companies are motivated to project leadership in [[AI]] for financial gains, though many [[AI]] initiatives are not yet profitable, and the practical limitations of [[AI]] deployment suggest a need for cautious and realistic engagement with the technology.
