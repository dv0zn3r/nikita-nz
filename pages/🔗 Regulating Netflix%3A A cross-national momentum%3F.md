	- Audiovisual media governance is influenced by internal and international factors, including technological interdependence, international commitments, and political influence. The emergence of global video-on-demand (VOD) platforms disrupts the audiovisual industry, creating incentives or constraints for the development of regulations. National policy responses to VOD platforms are shaped by state-society relationships, global interdependence, and political dynamics, leading to cooperation or conflict among stakeholders. Policies should aim for a level playing field, promote diverse cultural content, and improve access to data on digital content supply and consumption.
