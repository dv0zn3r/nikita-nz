	- >“Prompt” of course is one of those funny words with many meanings. A prompt is an instruction given to an LLM, but it can also mean to encourage; or to be quick; or to be on time (“be there at 4:00 o’clock prompt”). With that in mind, humans are promptly becoming prompt engineers. Perhaps that is the future of many cognitive jobs. But then surely there will be an AI to help us engineer prompts.
