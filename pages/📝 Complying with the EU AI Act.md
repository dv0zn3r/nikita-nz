	- This paper discusses the proposed [[EU AI Act]] and categorises its key elements. It presents a questionnaire-based study that identifies challenges in compliance for organisations. The study analyzes quantitative and qualitative data to provide insights into compliance issues and highlights the need for support in addressing these challenges.
	- #### Key takeaways:
		- [1] The study reveals that organisations face various challenges in complying with the [[EU AI Act]], with lower scores in technical documentation compared to model monitoring and risk management.
		- [2] The duration of AI usage and organisational characteristics like being an IT organization or non-IT organization do not significantly impact compliance scores.
		- [3] The findings highlight the need for organisations to enhance their readiness for the [[EU AI Act]] and the importance of providing support and guidance to address compliance issues effectively. A related project is developing a custom large language model to assist organisations in understanding and complying with the [[EU AI Act]]. #[[Custom LLMs]]
