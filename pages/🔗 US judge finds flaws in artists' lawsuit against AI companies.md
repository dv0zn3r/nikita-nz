	- A group of artists filed a lawsuit against [generative AI]([[Generative AI]]) companies, accusing them of copyright infringement. U.S. District Judge William Orrick signaled that he might dismiss most of the claims but allowed the artists to file a new complaint. Judge Orrick suggested that the artists should provide clearer and more specific allegations against the AI companies and present more evidence of copyright infringement. However, he indicated that illustrator [[Sarah Andersen]]'s claim against [[Stability AI]] for direct copyright infringement might have merit. The hearing provides insight into how judges may handle similar cases involving the use of copyrighted material to train AI systems.
