- Logseq is a software tool that serves as a note-taking and knowledge management system. It provides users with a flexible and interconnected platform for organizing and structuring their thoughts, ideas, and information. Logseq is designed to facilitate the process of capturing, linking, and navigating through different pieces of knowledge, allowing users to easily create a knowledge graph by connecting related concepts and topics. The software combines elements of a markdown editor, outlining tool, and graph database, offering users the ability to create and access their notes in a hierarchical and non-linear manner. Logseq also provides features such as backlinks, which allow users to keep track of referenced information, and bi-directional linking, enabling users to establish connections between different notes to enhance their understanding and discover new insights.
